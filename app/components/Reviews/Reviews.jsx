          <p>I was really pleased with the overall shopping experience. My order even included a little personal, handwritten note, which delighted me!</p>
          <p>The product quality is amazing, it looks and feel even better than I had anticipated. Brilliant stuff! I would gladly recommend this store to my friends. And, now that I think of it... I actually have, many times!</p>
